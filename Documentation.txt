AudioManager

Contains all the audiosources and clips of the whole game ranging from sound effects to music.


How to add new audio to AudioManager?
	- Audio array, based on Sound -script, is located within AudioManager Ã¡utomatically creates audiolisteners for the manager. Sound -script has multiple settings to easily change settings for the created audiolistener. **NOTE**: Remember to check soundtrack -boolean as true, if added audio is a soundtrack. This makes the AudioManager to recognize it as OST and add it to the soundtrack player.
